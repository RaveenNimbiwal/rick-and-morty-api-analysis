****Rick and Morty API Analysis****

This project explores the Rick and Morty Public API by collecting character data, cleaning it, and preparing it for analysis.
The goal was to practice working with REST APIs in Python and understand how to handle pagination, nested JSON, and dataset creation.

The notebook fetches character data from all available API pages and extracts useful fields such as:

- Character name
- Status (Alive, Dead, Unknown)
- Species
- Gender
- Origin
- Current location
- Image URL
- Number of episodes appeared in

All records are combined into a clean Pandas DataFrame ready for further exploration or visualization.
